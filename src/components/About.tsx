          <p>
            Hello, I'm Hilal. As I mentioned in the beginning part, I am a very new frontend developer.
            Let me tell you my story. I graduated from Sakarya University Computer and Instructional Technologies
            department in 2020 as the 3rd in the department. Due to covid-19 during my graduation, I had to teach
            for a short time. But then an important opportunity came my way. I participated in the Front-End Training
            Program at BilgeAdam company for 3 months. During the training process, I developed many projects such as
            RestApi applications, Dynamic websites, Web applications, the technologies used in the projects I developed,
            I explained in detail in the "My Projects" section. After successfully completing the training, I will join
            the Åžekerbank team.
          </p>
